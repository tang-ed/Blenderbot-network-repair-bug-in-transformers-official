# Blenderbot-network-repair-bug-in-transformers-official
This library will fix the bug in blenderbot of transformers. Unfortunately, the official model cannot be loaded. You can train the model yourself.
The ownership of the changed library still belongs to the official of transformers, and I do not bear any legal responsibility.
The only drawback of the library is that it can't call the pre training model and can only train from scratch. Then I found bug in the process of training from scratch, so I copied the source code in transformers and modified it.
